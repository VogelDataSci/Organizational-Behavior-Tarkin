# Organizational-Behavior-Tarkin

Tarkin is an R-Shiny application for Organizational Network Analysis. It is broadly applicable for importing any tabular dataset with categorical variables and performing meta-network analysis, though in development it was tailored for importing my organization's co-billing data. 

The founding idea was that projects and groups within the laboratory would like to get a better sense of who their primary collaborators are. Using filtering metrics like Jaccard Similarity to prune the graph from being fully connected, a group or project can observe which collborations are strongest. Then the organization can plan a network intervention, if needed, to increase partnership and links between groups and projects where collaboration is beneficial. In addition, this provides an easy metric to show whether a network intervention was effective. 

I took up development of this project after mentoring my ASPIRE mentee Hannah Kim through some of the priliminary steps, and then I generalized the code. It was presented at the North American Social Networks Conference during a workshop called "Organizational Network Analysis using R Shiny", where I co-presented with Ian McCulloh, Chief Data Scientist of Accenture Federal Services.
